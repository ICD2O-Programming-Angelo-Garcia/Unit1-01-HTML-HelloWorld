    <h1>Hi my name is Angelo and these are my dislikes, hobbies, and least or best favorite subject!</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Angelo One of my interest that I like ar firstly reading , and writing because writing not only is an everyday skill, but also a way to express yourself by writing down new ideas, and express knowledge, as well as to provide you with more clarity.</p>
  </body>In my free time , on a typical day I mostly like to write as I stated before to express my ideas whether they are future ideas or just planning ideas in general , reading is also a great hobby because reading is an every day hobby for most people because it allows you to fully understand new ideas in many ways of looking at it wherther it's a lesson book , or just a regular book in general. I also spend my time in gaming in my free time i typically like adventure games, as well as fighting , with a lot of world exploration and especially lore and readings within those games. '

But give my interst in reading and writing as for my favourite subject it would be english for me because it's very easy and simple to work at at a steady pace.
